Domain Modeling:


1--> Domain Modeling has following steps:

        • Identify concepts (classes)
        • Their properties (attributes/fields)
        • Their behaviors (operations/methods)
        • And the relationships between them
        
        
2--> Grammatical Parsing:In this method we assign roles based on parts of speech

        • Noun: class or attribute
        • Adjective: attribute or subclass
        • Verb: operation
        
        For example:
        “Graduate and undergraduate students may apply to the program.The application consists of a recommendation
         letter and personal statement.”
         
                Nouns:
                        • Students
                        • Program
                        • Application
                        • Letter
                        • Statement
               Adjectives:
                        • Graduate
                        • Undergraduate
