Good Software:

1) There are two factors regards to software quality.
      External factors: These factors deals with the human experience.
      Internal factors:These factors are related to the programmer.
2) External Quality:

             Functionality: satisfies stated or implied needs
             
             Reliability: maintains a level of performance in a given
             environment for a given period of time
            
             Usability: ease with which user can understand, learn,
             and operate the software
            
             Efficiency: limits the amount/number of resources
             used
            
             Portability: ease with which software can be
             transferred from one environment to another
            
             Security: level of confidentiality and integrity provided
             by the software
            
3) Internal Quality meaning:

       Ease with which a programmer can:
             understand the code
             add new functionality
             modify existing functionality
             reuse code
             incorporate new code
             identify and fix defects
             modify the code to improve external quality
4) Aspects of Internal quality:
     (i) Analyzability: Ease with which a programmer can read, understand, and reason about the code
                  It involves:
                       - Identify and fix defects
                       - Add or improve functionality
                       - Understand how an algorithm (solution) is implemented
                       - Improve other aspects of software quality (efficiency, security, etc.)
     (ii) Changeability: Ease with which a programmer can change the code
                  It involves:
                      - Fix defects
                      - Add or improve functionality
                      - Incorporate new code
                      - Improve other aspects of software quality(efficiency, security, etc.)
